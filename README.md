# TIL

> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day.

I used to keep [a similar HOWTO section over at my blog](https://taoofmac.com/space/HOWTO), but the idea of experimenting with a fresh, public repository of useful snippets is appealing to me, and it is much better than a bunch of random `gists`.

Some of these are actually backlog items I have learned over the years but keep misplacing, so they're not always "fresh" info.

## About

I was spurred to do this after browsing through [`jbranchaud/til`](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), which is an especially good example of the genre.

It is also quite easy to navigate (and search) inside GitHub, VSCode and a CLI prompt, so that's a plus.
