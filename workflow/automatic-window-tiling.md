# Automatic Window Tiling

## Linux

[Pop!_OS][popos], the Linux distro developed by [System76][system76], almost makes up for its silly name by shipping with a very nicely done auto-tiling Gnome shell extension (available at [`pop-os/shell`](https://github.com/pop-os/shell)):

## macOS

[Magnet][magnet] does the same thing on macOS, and if it supported saving pre-defined window layouts I would switch away from [Moom][moom].

## Windows

[PowerToys for Windows 10][ptoys] includes [FancyZones](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/tree/master/src/modules/fancyzones), which lets you define tiling zones.
