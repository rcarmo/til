# Running Web Apps as Desktop Apps

## macOS

* [Fluid](https://fluidapp.com) is the traditional approach for this (and has a number of great features like detailed URL handling and separate cookie storage).
* [`jiahaog/nativefier`](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) is a CLI utility that will wrap a website as a standalone Electron app and is [available as a `brew` formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/nativefier).

## Windows

You can use Microsoft Edge (Chromium) to do something similar by selecting `More Tools | Add to Desktop...` and checking `Open as window` (Edge does not have this latter option on the Mac).
